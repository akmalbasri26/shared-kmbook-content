## Are there any student privileges I can benefit from?

There are tons of student privileges here! Here are a few examples:

- **Amazon Prime**: free same-day or next-day delivery for 6 months after you register.
- **Microsoft Office 365**: As a student, you will have access to Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook and Powerpoint for free upon registering using your student email.
- **Unidays/Student Beans**: These are apps containing a lot of student discount codes from top brands and services.
- Many retailers in the UK offer student discounts as long as you show your student ID card or your Unidays account. But student discounts are usually only given if you hold a membership with the retailer.
- Certain banks also provide privileges for students. The incentives are different from each bank (for instance, Santander gives a free 4-year railcard), so do your own reading online and find out which bank offers the best perks for you. You might not even want any of the perks some banks offer because they do come with a cost.

**Tip:** Bring your Student ID everywhere you go as you can ask for student discounts at most shops you go. Do not be afraid to ask for a student discount when shopping!
