## Where to search for accommodation?

There are several places to search for accommodations:

- **University accommodations** (your universities may have emailed you about this)
- **Private student accommodations**
- **Private rentals**,

usually from websites such as Zoopla, Rightmove, OpenRent, Gumtree, or from Facebook pages such as Malaysian Students Good Exchange London and Malaysia Students Flat Exchange London.

There are also websites which provide hostels for university students such as Beaumont House (owned by MARA), Victoria League Student House, University of London Housing Services.

## How to search?

Traditionally, you can search for your future homes from the websites mentioned above. Alternatively, you might want to simply just opt for your university student accommodation. You may also contact any of your seniors who might have any available slot in their houses (very rare in London), or perhaps have very kind landlords who happen to have available properties ðŸ˜‰.

In any case, make sure to get help from those who have experience. You really donâ€™t want to get involved in any housing scams (unless as a scammer ðŸ¤‘).

## How much should I pay for rent?

Try to cap it around Â£600, with Â± 50 monthly per person. Itâ€™s better if it includes the bills (water, electric, wi-fi). If itâ€™s possible to walk from your home, itâ€™s better. Also, an important note: If you managed to find a suitable housing, usually they will state it in per week rate. So, to calculate how much you are going to pay for a month, take the value stated and multiply it by 52 weeks and then divide by 12 months. Take an example, the weekly rent for the whole house is Â£600. So, the monthly rent for the whole house is Â£600\*52/12= Â£2600. Therefore, to calculate the monthly rate per person, just divide it by the number of tenants in the house. Letâ€™s say, 4 tenants. We will get Â£2600/4= Â£650.

## How do I choose which area should I live?

Choose based on these criteria:

- Distance from your accommodation to campus
- Security â€“ certain areas are dodgy and unsafe. You can check crime statistics at https://www.met.police.uk/
- Price â€“ the further it is from Central London, the cheaper the rent is (hypothetically) (but keep in mind travel price by tube/train would get more expensive as the number of zones increase) \_
- Facilities â€“ near to grocery store, tube or bus station.
- Landlord â€“ find someone who does not burden your student life if not someone who can ease it.

Small note: Try to avoid East London. But itâ€™s still fine.

## What should I do if I donâ€™t have any UK guarantor if it is requested in the contract?

Hereâ€™s a few things you can do:
Lenient landlord or agent will accept non-UK based guarantor. However, you should discuss this with all parties involved.  
Negotiate with landlord or agent to accept Financial Statement (FS) as a guarantee.  
Certain universities offer guarantor service, though this might be charged. And keep in mind, during this pandemic, some university services might be unavailable.  
Usage of guarantor services such as Housing Hand or UKGuarantor (will be charged, you can check their websites to check the cost)
Landlords might opt for a 6-months lump sum payment if you don't have UK guarantor. (NOT ADVISABLE to choose this!)

You'll receive 6 months' worth of allowance from MARA (lump sum) prior to departure so it's not a problem to pay this demanded 6-months payment. However, you'd most likely canâ€™t afford the second 6-months (total rent duration is 1 year).

So, your first 6-months in the UK, ask from MARA London for proof of allowance that shows you are receiving allowance on a monthly basis. Ask your landlord to accept monthly rental payments instead of 6-months, as you are still students.

However, note that this option does have the slight risk of the landlord not accepting the proof of payment.

## I found a suitable accommodation but itâ€™s a bit expensive. Is there any way I could get it for a lower budget?

Negotiate with landlord to add another tenant. Or maybe 2.
Let them know you have financial constrictions. Some landlords are thoughtful and willing to reduce their price.

## I canâ€™t seem to find a house before arrival. What should I do?

Itâ€™s fine because itâ€™s normal. What you can do is, tumpang any kawan yang dah ada rumah or rent Airbnb while you are looking for accommodation.
