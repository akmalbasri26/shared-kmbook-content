## What is the difference between Financial Affidavit (FA) and Financial Statement (FS)?

**FA** doesn't have the exact amount of money written on it but **FS** does.

## Is the CAS letter the same as the Unconditional Offer letter?

No, they are two different things.

## Is it a must that the Unconditional Offer letter has an official university letterhead?

No. Some of the seniors used the unconditional offer letter from UCAS, and the process goes just as smooth (with MARA, immigration, everywhere).
